# FakeEmail
Machine learning for fake email detection
This project aims to detect fake or fraudulent emails using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of labeled emails and trains a machine learning model to classify emails as either genuine or fake based on various features and patterns.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw email data to remove noise, handle missing values, and convert text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- Machine Learning Models: Utilize various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines, to train a classifier for email classification.
- Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Prediction: Predict whether a given email is genuine or fake using the trained model.
